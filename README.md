# N Parallel MTs Simulation
The repository is for storing one-sided microtubules simulation code written in Igor pro. This computational model will help to understand MT bunldes and their behvaiours. 
Due to Github file-size restriction, only procedure files (.ipf) are up-to-date.
The programming language used in Igor pro is similar to Java. <br/>
Feb.10 update: Implement change point detection in Igor Pro based on ED-PLET method. Source: https://aakinshin.net/posts/edpelt/
